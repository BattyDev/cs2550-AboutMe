<!--Make a level-2 header titled something like: “My personal interests”
Give me three paragraphs, with three or more sentences each. In each paragraph talk about something you’re interested in.-->
<h2>My personal interests</h2>
<p>I really love my dogs. My wife and I have two: a Jack Russell–Chihuahua mix named Opal and a Terrier mix named Bandit. We've had both for about five years now, and we love training them and taking them out for exercise. Opal is pretty great at agility courses! Unfortunately, the location closest to us with equipment went out of business recently. We're looking for other ways to keep her busy!</p>
<p>I'm also very into Gundam, as my "About Me" page probably makes clear. It all started with a model kit I picked up from Target one weekend as a fun project, and it quickly spiraled into TV shows, movies, more model kits, and now the trading card game. What started out as a casual hobby has grown into a large portion of my personality and bookshelf.</p>
<p>Finally I like to play video games with friends and family members. My wife, brothers, cousins, dad, uncle, and a couple of in-laws all play Fortnite and it's turned into one big family chat with occasional battles. It's been a great way to keep in touch with people I may not get to see too frequently. Please do not ask me how much I've spent on Vbucks.</p>

<!--For the Class Schedule I want you to create a table that shows your weekly class schedule. This is easy to do using table elements, but it does require some attention to detail. 

Make a level-2 header titled “class schedule”
Create a table with 6 columns.
Set the border size to 1, so I can see the borders for each cell. Set the cell spacing to 3, and set the cell padding to 3.
The header row should have a blank cell, followed by cells for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. If you have a Saturday class (you poor soul), you can add a sixth column (or not, I don’t care, really).
Going down the left side of the table, I want you to list out the hours of your week-day in 30-minute increments. You can start as early as you feel necessary.
List the classes you have as cells. Use the row-span element to block out as many 30-minute cells as you need for each item.  If you have stuff that starts at an odd time, then guess.  I won’t care, as long as it doesn’t look all wonky.
Fill up your schedule. Make stuff up if you have to.  I want to see at least four classes that run M-W-F or Tu-Th or every weekday.  In addition to classes, You can put your employment, your work-out time, your commute time, or anything else you like.
Use the rowspan attribute, so if you have an hour-long class, the cell should take up two rows, without a line between them.-->
